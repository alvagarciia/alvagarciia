## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alvaro, and I'm a University of Arkansas junior majoring in Computer Science, interested in all things in Python, AI, and software development!

- ðŸŒ± I recently built a psychologist-inspired chatbot that helps users go on an introspection journey, check it out [here](https://github.com/alvagarciia/eunoia).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source LLM projects!
  - Send me a DM on [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/alvaro-garciam) if you have a crazy idea :)
